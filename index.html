                <p>Put the chicken, carrots, celery and onion in a large soup pot and cover with cold water. Heat and
                    simmer, uncovered, until the chicken meat falls off of the bones (skim off foam every so often).</p>

                <h2>Jimmy Dean Break-fast</h2>
                <p>The Jimmy Dean Sausage, Egg & Cheese Croissant Sandwiches are moderately decent breakfast sandwiches,
                    despite some flaws. We think they'll do in a pinch if you're craving a breakfast sandwich in a rush.
                    If you have more time to prepare something, however, there are certainly better options out there.

                <h2>Beef Flank Steak</h2>
                <p> Beef flank steak is cut of meat from the cow's abdominal muscle. It is extremely lean and muscular
                    with
                    very little fat but carries an intense, rich beefy flavor. Flank steak is a relatively long, flat
                    cut of
                    beef, about a foot long, less than one-inch thick with very distinct grains.</p>
